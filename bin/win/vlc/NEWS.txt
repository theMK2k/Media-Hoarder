Important notes:

   conflicts with some URLs and file names. For instance, this plays a DVD
   from the 2nd chapter of the 1st title up to the 4th chapter of the 3rd
   title:  vlc dvd://#1:2-3:4
 * The 40+ --*-caching options were simplified and dumbed down to 4 options:
   - --file-caching specifies caching for local files,
   - --network-caching specifies caching for network resources,
   - --live-caching specifies caching for capture devices and
   - --disc-caching specifies caching for local optical media.
   All values are expressed in milliseconds as in previous versions.
 * HTTP server IP address, port, and TLS configuration is now centralized:
   - The --http-host option sets the address, e.g. "--http-host=[2001:db8::1]".
     By default, both :: and 0.0.0.0 are used.
   - The --http-port and --https-port options set the port numbers.
     By default, 8080 is used for HTTP, and 8443 for HTTPS.
   - The TLS credentials are configured with --http-cert (public certificate),
     --http-key (private key), --http-ca (optional CA) and
     --http-crl (optional CRL).
 * RTSP server IP address and port are updated similarly.
   Use --rtsp-host and --rtsp-port respectively.
 * The --miface-addr option does not exist anymore. To select the multicast
   output interface, use --miface instead, e.g. --miface=eth0.

   not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script.
   Non-UTF-8 file systems support will be removed in future versions.
 * The VLC plugins path can be overridden with the VLC_PLUGIN_PATH environment
   variable. The --plugin-path command line option was removed.

   generated at install time except if you use staged installation. In the
   later case, you can generate the module cache in your post-inst script

   can't write in ${libdir}/vlc/, it will result it vlc taking a long time to
   launch each time.

   - xproto,
   - xcb, xcb-shm, xcb-xv, xcb-randr (from libxcb),
   - xcb-keysyms (from xcb-utils),

---------------------------------

Important notes:
----------------
 * This release will need Windows 2000 and Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), or more
   recent to work correctly
 * The HTTP interface is now only available on the local machine by default.
   If you want to make it available from other machines, you will have to
   edit the ".hosts" file.
   - On UNIX/Linux, the file is in /usr/share/vlc/http/.hosts
     If you're using the old http interface, it's located in
     /usr/share/vlc/http/old/.hosts
   - On Windows they are in C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\.hosts and
     C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\old\.hosts
   - On Mac OS X, you can find it in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/.hosts
     and respectively in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/old/.hosts
 * This version of VLC contains a new interface for Windows and Linux.
   This interface has a fullscreen controller and simplified preferences.
   This interface lacks the "Streaming Wizard" that used to be present in VLC
   0.8.6, but provides basic profiles.
 * The behavior of --sout-keep was changed. It's now activated by default.
 * The marq, mosaic and logo commands in the rc interface changed. They
   now require a target name as their first argument. Example:
   vlc --sub-filter "marq@test{marquee=Hello}" -I rc <somevideo>
   You can then use commands like: @test marq-marquee Goodbye
   If you didn't name the object using @test, its name will default to the
   plugin name (hence 'marq') in this example.
   These new commands are also available in the telnet interface.
 * The "rtp" access output module has been removed.
   Please use the RTP stream output instead, e.g.:
     Old: '#std{access=rtp,mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2:5004,sap}'
     New: '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2,port=5004,sap}'
 * You now need to append --m3u-extvlcopt to your command line to enable
   EXTVLCOPT options parsing in m3u playlists. Note that only a limited set
   of options is available to m3u playlists (CVE-2007-6683).
 * The old access:url syntax is no longer supported to resolve ambiguities
   with some file names. Use access://url instead.
    E.g.:  vlc:quit -> vlc://quit ;
           udp:@239.255.12.12 -> udp://@239.255.12.12
 * The ffmpeg module has been removed and replaced by the new avcodec,
   avformat, swscale (or imgresample if you use a swscale-less ffmpeg build)
   and postproc modules.
 * The web plugins ActiveX (IE)/Firefox/Mozilla/Safari now recognize the
   following states: IDLE/CLOSE=0, OPENING=1, BUFFERING=2, PLAYING=3, PAUSED=4,
   STOPPING=5, FORWARD=6, BACKWARD=7, ENDED=8, ERROR=9. With FORWARD and
   BACKWARD being reserved for future implementations and are thus not
   functional atm.
 * Croping and padding in transcode are now done using the croppadd video
   filter. For example:
   transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=croppadd{cropttop=20,cropbottom=30,paddleft=100}}
 * Canvas setting in transcode is now done using the canvas video filter.
   For example:
   transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=480}}
 * Glide video output module has been removed.
