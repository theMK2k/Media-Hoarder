# Media Hoarder v1.1.0 Changelog

## Feature: AI Recommendations powered by ChatGPT

The news of ChatGPT spread like wildfire and it is perfectly able to recommend movies to your criteria and name their IMDB IDs. Now you can initiate a conversation with ChatGPT from within Media Hoarder and every mentioned movie - as long as you have it in your collection - can be filtered.

Examples:

- _Provide a list of christmas themed action movies and their IMDB ID_
- _Provide a list of mind bending movies and their IMDB ID_
- _Provide a list of Oscar winning best motion picture between 2000 and 2010 and their IMDB ID_
- _Provide a list of classic Sci-Fi movies that were not made by Hollywood and their IMDB ID_

## PersonDialog: add button for (re-)fetching data from imdb.com

In order to fetch the latest data from imdb.com for a person (directors, actors, etc.) a button has been added to the person dialog title.

## Other Fixes

- MediaList: minor positioning correction for action icons in media items
- Show/Hide version history, hidden by default when you have the latest version
