# Media Hoarder v1.3.0 Changelog

## IMDB axed rating demographics

Unfortunately IMDB axed the rating demographics which provided ratings and number of votes for:

- genders
- US/non-US
- age ranges

At least the ratings by age ranges were quite helpful in order to find out if a movie targets a more mature demographic.

But, oh well, now they are gone and **Media Hoarder** had to remove that feature. We'll keep an eye out if the rating demographics return in a similar fashion.

## IMDB Scraper updated

- TODO: plot keywords
- TODO: locations

## Other Improvements and Fixes

- New main list action: copy info _copies informations about the complete filtered and sorted list including your rating, title and imdb link_
