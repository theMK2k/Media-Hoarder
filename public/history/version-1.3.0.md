# Media Hoarder v1.3.0 Changelog

## Last MacOS signed release?

Media Hoarder has been released as an officially signed application until now. Apple still wants to receive 99USD per year no matter if you want to provide a **free piece of software** or not. This is unbearable and I won't put any more money into Apple's mouth. I'm unsure if Media Hoarder can still be used without being signed, let's see... so for the time being, v1.3.0 will be the last signed MacOS release of Media Hoarder.

## Trailer Rotation

The list actions menu (three dots in the top right corner of the main list) got two new actions:

- Start Trailer Rotation (Ordered)
- Start Trailer Rotation (Randomized)

These actions will start a trailer rotation of the underlying list of movies, either in sort order (e.g. by release year, rating, title etc.) or randomized. During trailer rotation you can add the current shown movie to a list of your choice, this way you can collect some "chosen movies" while watching the trailers.

## Trailer Dialog

The trailer dialog has been updated for a better watching experience and uses the maximum available screen space including full screen if you choose.
