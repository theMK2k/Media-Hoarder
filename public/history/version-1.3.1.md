# Media Hoarder v1.3.1 Changelog

## Excluding Genres Filter (since v1.3.1)

With v1.3.1 it is now possible to filter e.g.:

- "Action without Horror"
- "Comedy without Drama"
- "Anything without Family, Music OR Musical"

For this, the genres filters have a new option "Exclude this genre".

Watch this [very short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejcjo6OMRt4) to learn how to use it.

## Last MacOS signed release!

Media Hoarder has been released as an officially signed application until now. Apple still wants to receive 99USD per year no matter if you want to provide a **free piece of software** or not. This is unbearable and I won't put any more money into Apple's mouth. I'm unsure if Media Hoarder can still be used without being signed, let's see... so for the time being, v1.3.0 is the last signed MacOS release of Media Hoarder.

## Trailer Show

The **list actions** menu (three dots in the top right corner of the main list) got two new actions:

- Start Trailer Show (Ordered)
- Start Trailer Show (Randomized)

These actions will start a trailer show of the underlying list of movies, either in sort order (e.g. by release year, rating, title etc.) or randomized. During the trailer show you can add the current shown movie to a list of your choice, this way you can collect some "chosen movies" while watching the trailers. Of course you can also close the trailer show and let Media Hoarder search for the currently shown movie.

Here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p_RNd9xrbA) showcasing this feature.

## Trailer Dialog

The trailer dialog has been updated for a better watching experience and uses the maximum available screen space including full screen if you choose.
