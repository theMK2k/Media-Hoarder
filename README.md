## IMDB ID detection

In order to retrieve metadata from IMDB, **Media Hoarder** needs to find out the IMDB ID for each movie.

### IMDB ID as part of the file name

If the actual IMDB ID is part of the file name, **Media Hoarder** will immediately use it. The ID must be of the format "tt0000000".

Example:

```text
The Godfather [tt0068646].mkv
```

### IMDB ID is not part of the file name

If the actual IMDB ID is not part of the filename, **Media Hoarder** tries to detect the correct IMDB entry by performing an IMDB search with parts of the filename.

It is greatly beneficial if the file name also provides the movie's release year.

We ran tests utilizing the following constructed test set:

- mix of well-known and obscure movies
- movie title in German localization
- 2648 movies in total
- manually labelled with the correct IMDB ID for comparison

Result of the test:

- 2553 of 2648 movies correctly detected
- 95 of 2648 movies incorrectly detected
