# Parental Guidance / Rating

Media Hoarder strictly uses an age-based numerical system to reflect the rating of certain movies.

As some countries don't excplicitly state the age in their ratings, e.g. "PG", "T", "X" etc. Media Hoarder translates these codes into numerical age values. Of course this is a bit opinionated ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Age|Codes
-|-
0+|"b.o.", "Tous+publics", "Tous+Public"
6+|"U", "Tous+publics+avec+avertissement"
12+|"T", "PG", "NRC", "GP"
18+|"Unrated", "X", "XXX", "SOA"
